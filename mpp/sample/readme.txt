Usage Descriptions of the HiSilicon Hi3516A Sample Programs

1. Sample Program File Structure
   sample            # MPP sample program
    |-- common       # Common function used by the sample program
    |-- vio          # Video input/output implementation demo
    |-- venc         # Video encoding implementation demo
    |-- region       # Region implementation demo
    |-- vda          # Video detection analysis (VDA) implementation demo
    |-- audio        # Audio implementation demo
    |-- hifb         # Frame buffer (FB) implementation demo
    |-- tde          # TDE implementation demo
    |-- ......    


2. Compilation and Makefile
   1) Compilation dependency descriptions
   The compilation of the sample programs depends on MPP header files in /mpp/include and library files in mpp/lib.
   
   2) Makefile descriptions    
   A Makefile is available on each service sample demo module (such as the vio and venc). The Makefile quotes the Makefile.param file in the sample directory, and this file quotes the Makefile.param file in the mpp directory.
   mpp -- Makefile.param                 # Defines the variables required by the MPP compilation.
    |---sample---Makefile.param          # Defines the variables required by the sample compilation.
          |--- vio/venc/...---Makefile   # Sample compilation script

   Run the make command on each service sample demo module to compile the module; run the make clean command to delete the executable files and target files after compilation; run the make cleanstream command to delete stream files generated after some of the sample programs run. 

   Run the make command in the sample directory to compile various service sample demo programs; run the make clean command to delete the executable files and target files after all service sample demo programs are compiled; run the make cleanall command to delete stream files generated after all service sample demo programs run.

3. Running Descriptions of Sample Programs
   1) Sample program running depends on the media driver. Before running a sample demo program, execute the load3518 script in the mpp/ko_hi3518 to load a specified module.
   
   2) Note that the corresponding sensor library must be selected. The default sensor is Aptina AR0130. If you want to select other sensors, modify the Makefile.param file. For example, if you select Sony IMX104, you should modify the Makefile.param file as follows:
   		#SENSOR_TYPE ?= SONY_IMX185_MIPI_1080P_30FPS
	 	SENSOR_TYPE ?= PANASONIC_MN34220_SUBLVDS_1080P_30FPS
